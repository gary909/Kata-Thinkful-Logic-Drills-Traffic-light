    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a
      function to handle each <br />
      change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.<br />
      <br />
      Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the
      current state of the <br />
      light and returns a string representing the state the light should change
      to.<br />
      <br />
      For example, update_light('green') should return 'yellow'.<br />
